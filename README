NOTE :

I have tested  my code on Windows 10 using Python 2.7.13. I have NOT tested the code against Python 3 and it is quite possible the code fails with Python 3.

RUNNING THE CODE:

1) Create a directory say c:\test and cd to this directory
1) Clone my code from Github :  git clone https://github.com/raghavanks/ud036_StarterCode.git
2) At the command line, type:  python entertainment_center.py

This should open a browser instance depending on your configuration.
